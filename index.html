                    <p>If you're tired of "hoping" to find someone who really understands <b>Local SEO</b> , go no further. 
                        As an SEO strategist, I am a problem-solver and communicator who can help you get ranked on Google 
                        for your local business. With all of the changes in <b><a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> </b>  and their algorithm updates, you need 
                        someone who stays up to date on what's working and what's not working in the world of content for 
                        your website. My goal is to provide an excellent experience for you so you know your money is well 
                        spent.
                    </p>
    
                        <p>
                            Organic ranking in Google is the #1 ticket to getting noticed on Google and putting your 
                            hard-earned dollars to work so you can bring in even more clients. If you're tired of getting burned 
                            by <b><a href="https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~016ce881d474a22c8b" target="_blank">"SEO Experts"</a></b> who won't take the time to have a conversation with you, or they won't show you 
                            what they're working on, or they won't tell you how you can help with your online marketing efforts... 
                            tell them goodbye and contact me. I'll be honest with you, and if I don't think I can help you, 
                            I'll let you know. 
                        </p>

                            If you really want to work with me, please take the time to write a personalized 
                            message that explains why you think we'd work well together. I'm interested in your business, 
                            your story, and your goals. What is amazing about your company? How do you see me contributing to your 
                            company? If I know you actually read this, it's more likely that you'll hear from me. :) Interested in 
                            hiring me for White Label work for your agency?
